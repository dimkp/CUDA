# CUDA
The repository contains Kernels from my CUDA learning journey and practice code. 
The code was created using CUDA C++ and was writen on Kaggle notebooks using the GPU T4 accelerator.
For the compilation and execution of the code was done using the following commands:
- !nvcc main.cu -o main
- !./main
